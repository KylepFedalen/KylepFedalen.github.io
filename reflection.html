      <p style ="font-size:20px;"> I have been programming for close to ten years and over those years I have grown exponentially in my in my own skill, ability, and style. I started programming when I was just 15 years old. A young and hopeful person that when asked “what do you want to do with your life?” would have probably have just looked at the asker of the question blankly and said ”I don’t know.”. However, when I was 15, I was a curious boy that loved puzzles and creativity and knowing how the world around me worked. And so it was when I started looking into how my favorite hobby, playing video games, worked was when I truly found my passion for programming. Since that time, I have strived to learn all that I could about how programming worked and what I needed to do to make it my carrier. </p>

      <p style ="font-size:20px;">And so, I continued to learn and grow and expand my repertoire of skills and knowledge of programming languages. Though It was not until my last year of high school that I started my formal programming education. From that point I started to learn more and more stack overflow, object-oriented programming, exception handling, binary search trees and more. </p>

      <p style ="font-size:20px;">I think the project I learned the most from was the Crayon Box API assignment that I was assigned in my first year of college for a final project for the Java Introduction course. In this project I was tasked with creating a Box of Crayons that each had a Color. In this assignment I was able to grasp how object orientated programming was structured and how objects were declared and called. And while I have since become comfortable and familiar with Object oriented programming that assignment is where it all clicked into place for me. </p>
