  <h2>Google: An Industry Leader</h2>
  <p> Google is a company in the tech industry that excites me. According to my research
  the company is leading the industry in multiple web technologies and services. Google is an exciting company to work for is that they are an industry 
  leader in web video and streaming with Youtube.
  </p>
  <h3>Exciting Projects</h3>
  <p>The company's work in consumer facing 
  products like google drive, docs, slides, sheets is also interesting because it deals 
  with massive data management and cloud storage. Google just recently announced that 
  they would be launching their own video game streaming service called google strada 
  which presents its own set of technical challenges. In addition to all that Google also 
  works on self driving car technology which greatly interests me.
  </p>
  <h3>Work Environment</h3>
  <p> 
  The work environment of the company is reported to be one of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-the-best-company-to-work-for-in-america-2016-4#googlers-say-their-compensation-is-the-best-3">best in the Industry</a>. 
  They offer a high salary and a relaxed, low stress work environment which adds to the appeal of working there. 
  Also offered with a job at google are perks that really aren't offered at any other company.
  These extra perks entail a free wifi enabled shuttles for the to and from work commute, telecommuting options,
  on-site massages, free fitness classes and gym memberships, and a vacation plan.
  </p>
  <h3>Skills Required</h3>
  <p>
  For those who want to start working for google need to acquire skills related to computer science
  and web programming. <a href="https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/">According to Google's hiring team</a>, a prospective employee must have a firm
  understanding of programming, an object oriented language like C++ ,Java or Python. In addition a
  good understanding of machine learning techniques and cloud computing are necessary to successfully
