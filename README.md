Write a brief reflection about your observations on using Media Queries and describe it's benefits and weaknesses.

Using Media Queries presents many benefits such as allowing websites to remain readable on many different devices. a disadvantage to using Media Queries is that it requires significantly more development time because you have to take into account the different requirements of different devices.

Write a brief reflection about your observations on using the Skeleton system and describe it's benefits and weaknesses. Compare it to using Media Queries for your portfolio home page. Was it better, faster, easier, harder?

When using the skeleton system I found that its strength lies in its ease of use and dynamic resizing. However, 
its weaknesses are that it doesn't really allow for non standard blocking without allot of work. compared to using media quarries, the skeleton system is easeir to implement for a majoroty of elements.
