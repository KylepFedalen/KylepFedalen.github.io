Media Queries
Using Media Queries presents many benefits such as allowing websites to remain readable on many different devices. a disadvantage to using Media Queries is that it requires significantly more development time because you have to take into account the different requirements of different devices.

Resume using skeleton
When using the skeleton system I found that its strength lies in its ease of use and dynamic resizing. However, 
its weaknesses are that it doesn't really allow for non standard blocking without allot of work. compared to using media quarries, the skeleton system is easeir to implement for a majoroty of elements.

Flexbox
I found using flexbox to be so much easier than using skeleton. the syntax of flexbox was conciderably easeir for me to understand and implement. I also found Flexbox to be more reliable in the results of its implementation than Skeleton.
